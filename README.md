> Real-time facial emotion detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks

A deep learning-based facial emotion recognition system that detects and classifies emotions in real-time from webcam feeds. The project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the FER2013 dataset to identify seven distinct facial emotions with over 60% accuracy.

Key Features:
- Real-time emotion detection from webcam at 1 FPS
- Custom CNN architecture optimized for emotion classification
- Comprehensive training pipeline with TensorBoard monitoring
- Face detection and preprocessing using OpenCV
- Seven emotion categories: Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, Disgust, Neutral

This project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, model training with early stopping, real-time inference, and deployment-ready code.
